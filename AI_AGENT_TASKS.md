# DevFolio AI Agent Tasks

This document contains small, precise tasks for AI agents to complete. Each task is self-contained and focuses on bug fixes, small feature additions, testing, and code improvements. Each task includes references to relevant documentation files.

> **NOTE FOR CODEX AGENTS**: This project is undergoing UI modernization to match the dark purple theme with gradient effects. All new components must use white text on dark backgrounds for better visibility and accessibility. Components should use gradient backgrounds, subtle animations, and consistent hover effects as detailed in the UI documentation. Refer to UI_DESIGN_DOCUMENTATION.md for the complete style guide and GlobalComponents.js/GlobalTheme.js for implementation examples.
